                 Hi! You've reached the personal website of <b>Ben Woodward</b>. ðŸ‘‹
              </p>
              <p>
              I was born and raised in Alaska and currently reside in Seattle, Washington, by way of a small town in Idaho and a lot of international travel. I enjoy the outdoors, photography, reading, rock climbing, and writing software.

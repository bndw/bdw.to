    In 2009 I joined my first startup. Founded by 3 Vulcan engineers, 
Triton Technical setout to provide the 
standard in highend AV/IT systems for <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/y.co/default/CALLISTO-0-5672e6f368a90_v_default_big.jpeg" target="_blank"> mega yachts</a>. I leveraged my formal 
education in Audio Engineering to help build and commission custom AV solutions. 
By the end of 2011 my initially hardware-focused role had all but shifted to software.
By the fall of 2012 I was writing software fulltime, building
custom touchpanels to control nearly every guest-accessible system onboard the vessel-
from lighting and HVAC to IPTV and navigation systems. Technically speaking, it ranged from 
low level hacking on IP, serial, and other communication protocols to buiding GUIs.
I spent most of this time traveling around the world building and deploying
systems at a whirlwind pace, everywhere from prominant European, Middle Eastern, and South American cities
to sleepy coastal towns and tropical villages.

    Toward the end of 2013, with nearly a full passport, I joined an early stage technology startup called Gratafy
to work on cloud software. As one of the first engineering hires
at a rapidly growing ecommerce company, I worked on everything 
from custom payment integrations for point-of-sale terminals, 
CI/CD pipelines, deconstructing a monolith, building and operationalizing microservices, 
writing ambitious single page webapps, and producing the company's first set of 
external APIs now used by some of the largest technology companies
in the world.

    At the beginning of 2017 I left Gratafy for the opportunity to join BackOffice Associates,
    a company producing industry-leading data governance and stewardship technology for large multi-national
    corporations. In my current role, I'm working on a small team responsible for building the company's next
    generation cloud infrastructure.
